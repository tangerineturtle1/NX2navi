"""Build Ocarina of Time (Switch 2, game 1.1.1) natively for Windows or Linux from the player's own game files.

    python -I tools/make_game.py --nup "C:\\path\\game.nup" --out "C:\\Games\\Ocarina"
    python -I tools/make_game.py --exefs "C:\\path\\exefs" --romfs "C:\\path\\romfs" --out "C:\\Games\\Ocarina"
    python -I tools/make_game.py --nup "C:\\path\\game.nup" --check          # only checks the game's version
    python -I tools/make_game.py --rebuild --out "C:\\Games\\Ocarina"         # a newer kit, the files of the last build

Steps, each skipped when a run before finished it for the same inputs (state in <out>/build-cache/state.json):
  1. check    the title (0400486024DEC000) and main's build id (game 1.1.1)
  2. exefs    the five ExeFS files, every module's segments unpacked (ZBIC through the player's own `zbic` package)
              and stored plainly, as the runtime's loader reads them -> <out>/exefs
  3. romfs    every RomFS file, checked against the container's sha256, into one image -> <out>/romfs/romfs.bin and
              index.json (16-byte aligned, in the byte order of the paths). When the lift and the compile follow, it
              runs on a thread of its own beside them: only the RomFS index and romfs.c wait for the image
  4. lift     recomp/gen.py with recomp/patches-v111.txt -> <out>/build-cache/lift, plus the two SDK bring-up fixes
  5. compile  the lifted C and runtime/ with MSYS2's clang, linked into <out>/ocarina.exe; the MSYS2 DLLs it loads,
              the shader translator and romfs-index.bin beside it
  6. shaders  every shader in the game files (tools/prepare_shaders.py, default bind state) translated, and each one's
              GPU driver build done once into the driver's own cache, so play stops for them far less often
              (`ocarina.exe --prepare-shaders`); variants met in play with another bind state are still translated
              then, and the driver cache is per executable and is lost when the driver clears it
  7. prompts  only with button art in the kit (<kit>/prompt-art, tools/make_launcher.py and make_kit.py
              --prompt-art): tools/pad_prompts.py draws the Xbox, PlayStation, Steam Deck and keyboard and mouse button prompts
              from it into <out>/romfs-patches-* (the Controls menu's Button prompts loads them), the keys as the
              bind_ lines of <out>/nx2navi.ini give them. Its key names everything it reads (the RomFS, the art, the
              tools, those lines), so it runs again only when one of them changed or a folder is gone, and running
              it makes no other step run again. A failure here leaves the game and its shaders complete.
  8. scan     tools/romfs_check.py decompresses every file of the game data once, writes <out>/romfs-check.json and
              makes stand-ins for damaged textures in <out>/mods. Its key names the game files and the check's
              version (SCAN_TOOL, changed by hand: an edit of the tool alone does not run it again), and it
              is last: nothing of it runs while the game does.
              Without art the step is skipped and the game shows its own prompts, as before

The exefs and romfs steps depend only on the game files; lift and compile depend on this kit's code too. A newer kit
therefore lifts and compiles again but keeps the unpacked game files, and --rebuild needs no game files at all. The
compile step keeps every object with the dependency list clang wrote for it (build-cache/obj/objects.json) and
compiles a file again only when it, a header it includes, the flags or the compiler changed; the kit's own folder
is not part of that key, so a kit in another folder (the launcher keeps each version in its own) reuses the objects.
The list goes to disk every 25 objects while the compile runs, so a compile that is cut short keeps what it finished.
A kit with lib/libnx2navirt.a built by --make-runtime-lib for the same runtime/ and the same compiler links the
runtime from it and compiles only the runtime files that include headers written per install. The new ocarina.exe
replaces the old one only once it links (with lld when the toolchain has it), so a failed build leaves the last good
one in place. Compiles run on every logical processor, or on as many as the free memory allows (default_jobs; --jobs
sets the number), the largest files first. The lifted code is built for this
PC's x86-64 level (cpu_level), with MSYS2 CLANG64's clang when it sits beside the UCRT64 folder and reports the same
version (fast_clang: the same objects, about a fifth faster).

    python tools/make_game.py --make-runtime-lib <kit>/lib --msys <ucrt64>   # the release's prebuilt runtime

On Linux the same steps make <out>/ocarina with the clang, clang++ and lld on PATH and the system's libraries
(Vulkan, SDL3, Opus, libvpx, dav1d, zstd; libstdc++ static, rpath $ORIGIN), as tools/build_game.py's Linux
build does: the runtime's *_sdl.* and platform/linux.c take the place of its *_win.*, platform/win32.c and
nx2navi.rc, and --msys is not used. VMA_INCLUDE can name the directory holding vk_mem_alloc.h; otherwise the
system header or the pinned download is used. README-BuildKit.md, "Linux", lists the packages.

Game content is written only to --out; a downloaded VMA header is cached in toolchain/vma, and --make-runtime-lib
writes DIR. The game folder holds only what this PC built from the player's files: never
share it. Needs Python 3.10+ with numpy, lz4, zstandard and zbic (pip), with fonttools and pillow too when the kit has
button art, and MSYS2 UCRT64's clang and libraries (README-BuildKit.md lists the commands). Delete <out>/build-cache
afterwards to free about 5 GB; the next build then compiles everything again.

--events adds one machine-readable line per step and progress change to stdout, each starting with "@@" and followed
by a JSON object (launcher/build.py reads them): {"ev": "step", "step": ..., "state": "start" | "done" | "skip"},
{"ev": "progress", "step": ..., "done": n, "total": n, "unit": ...}, {"ev": "phase", ...}, {"ev": "error", "message":
...} and {"ev": "end", ...}.

    first word: the .rc goes by its bare name from runtime/ as the working directory, where windres also finds the
